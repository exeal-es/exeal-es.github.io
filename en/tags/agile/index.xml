It&amp;rsquo;s the one that will determine whether we build our solution on solid foundations or unnecessarily complicate our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are three main things I ask of my first test:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Firstly, it should lay out the most important elements that will come into play, or the inputs and outputs of the system (a.k.a. the simplest &amp;ldquo;given&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Secondly, it should define how I will interact with the system, its facade, i.e., what is the public interface of my module or class (a.k.a. the simplest &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thirdly, it should capture the behavior of the simplest case involving all elements, or the simplest inputs and outputs (a.k.a. the simplest &amp;ldquo;then&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The aim here is to define the interfaces of all the pieces that will come into play and make them work as soon as possible with a very simple case, making it easier to incrementally grow the solution by adding more tests later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Slice Requirements to Continuously Deliver Value: Vertical Slicing</title><link>https://www.exeal.com/en/blog/2023/10/how-to-slice-requirements-to-continuously-deliver-value-vertical-slicing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.exeal.com/en/blog/2023/10/how-to-slice-requirements-to-continuously-deliver-value-vertical-slicing/</guid><description>&lt;p>When working on a software project of a certain size, we have to divide (slice, or &amp;ldquo;slice&amp;rdquo;) larger requirements into smaller, more manageable tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two ways to do this division: horizontal slicing and vertical slicing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we do horizontal slicing, we divide by a technical criterion (usually layers). We have one task for the front end, another for the back end, another for the database, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach presents us with 2 problems&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
