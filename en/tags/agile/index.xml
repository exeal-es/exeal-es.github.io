It&amp;rsquo;s the one that will determine whether we build our solution on solid foundations or unnecessarily complicate our lives.
There are three main things I ask of my first test:
Firstly, it should lay out the most important elements that will come into play, or the inputs and outputs of the system (a.k.a. the simplest &amp;ldquo;given&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title>How to Slice Requirements to Continuously Deliver Value: Vertical Slicing</title><link>https://www.exeal.com/en/blog/2023/10/how-to-slice-requirements-to-continuously-deliver-value-vertical-slicing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.exeal.com/en/blog/2023/10/how-to-slice-requirements-to-continuously-deliver-value-vertical-slicing/</guid><description>When working on a software project of a certain size, we have to divide (slice, or &amp;ldquo;slice&amp;rdquo;) larger requirements into smaller, more manageable tasks.
There are two ways to do this division: horizontal slicing and vertical slicing.
When we do horizontal slicing, we divide by a technical criterion (usually layers). We have one task for the front end, another for the back end, another for the database, etc.
This approach presents us with 2 problems</description></item></channel></rss>
