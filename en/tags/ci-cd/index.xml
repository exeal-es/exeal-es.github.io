&lt;p>This limits the frequency with which they can deliver working code to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When our goal is to increase the frequency of delivering value and, therefore, practice &lt;em>trunk-based development&lt;/em>, &lt;em>continuous integration&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>continuous delivery&lt;/em>, we seek the opposite: &lt;strong>to accelerate the frequency of our commits, as much as possible&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
